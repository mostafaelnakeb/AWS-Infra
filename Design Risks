We have a couple of high risk threats as described below, attached the mitigation as well 

Infrastructure protection
  Definition of risk: 
      There is a trust between on-prem and AWS environments, where the security control for securing all networking resources from on-prem to the cloud is based only on site-to-site VPN. 

  Mitigation:
    1- Utilize Security Group  
    2- Use Network Access List 
    3- Define connection in AWS TG router table 
    4- Enable GWLB 
    5- Enable AWS network Firewall 
    6- Enable Amazone Route 53 Resolver DNS firewall 

Incident Response
		Definition of risk: 
        Ransomware attacks might target the on-prem environment and lateral movement targets the cloud environment.
  
    Mitigations: 
        1- A quick containment block the traffic from the on-prem environment to the cloud or deny the access to the compromised account. 
        2- Automate incident response rather than leveraging the manual process to monitor the security posture and manual react to events
